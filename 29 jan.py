#TYPES OF ERRORS


# In[ ]:


Syntax Errors:

Definition: These errors occur when the rules of a programming language are not followed.
Example: Missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect variable names.


# In[ ]:


Runtime Errors:

Definition: These errors occur during the execution of a program and can cause it to terminate abruptly.
Example: Division by zero, accessing an array index out of bounds, or trying to open a non-existent file.


# In[ ]:


Logical Errors:

Definition: These errors do not cause the program to crash, but they result in incorrect or unexpected behavior.
Example: Flawed algorithm or incorrect conditional statements.


# In[ ]:


Semantic Errors:

Definition: These errors involve incorrect understanding of the meaning of code, leading to unintended results.
Example: Incorrect usage of variables, functions, or operators.


# In[ ]:


Compilation Errors:

Definition: These errors occur during the compilation phase of a program, preventing it from being translated into machine code.
Example: Undefined variables, missing libraries, or incompatible data type


# In[ ]:


Arithmetic Errors:

Definition: These errors involve mathematical operations and can result in incorrect calculations.
Example: Overflow (resulting in a value too large for the data type) or underflow (resulting in a value too small).


# In[ ]:


Network Errors:

Definition: These errors occur in computer networks and can affect communication between devices.


# In[ ]:


Human Errors:

Definition: Mistakes made by humans during the design, coding, or data entry phases.
Example: Typographical errors, incorrect data input, or misinterpretation of requirements.


# In[ ]:


Systematic Errors:

Definition: Persistent errors that consistently affect results in the same way.
Example: Instrument calibration errors, biased measurements, or flawed algorithms.


# In[ ]:


Random Errors:

Definition: Unpredictable errors that occur randomly and can affect the accuracy of measurements.
Example: Environmental noise, interference, or unpredictable system behavior.
